			<h3>
				2. Hawkshead
			</h3>
			<p>
				Carefully preserved Hawkshead was once home to William Wordsworth, who described it in his poem The
				Prelude. Beatrix Potter also lived here. Her former residence now open to the public – a great
				opportunity to feel snug inside a real English cottage.

				Hawkshead is a tourist mecca not only for its whitewashed cottages, old pubs and cobbled streets,
				but
				also for its location: the Lake District. A beautiful English town famous for its lakes, fells and
				forests, hiking in English countryside is supremely idyllic here.

			<h3>
				3. Beer
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yes, in Devon there is a town called Beer – unfortunately it’s named after Old English word bearu,
				meaning grove. Nevertheless there’s a disproportionate amount of pubs in this seaside town, all
				serving
				excellent local ales as well as the local speciality of crab. Steeped in tales of smuggling, the
				meandering hike down Hooken Cliffs to the west of town is great for imagining yourself as a smuggler
				of
				old.

				Just out of town are the 2,000-year-old Beer Quarry Caves, famous for its ‘beer stone’ –
				fine-textured
				limestone that was used in Westminster Abbey, among other places. Sitting on Beer’s pebble beach
				looking
				out to sea with an ice cream after a pub lunch is a fine example of English summer holidays.

			<h3>
				4. Lavenham
			</h3>
			<p>
				Medieval buildings lean higgledy-piggledy in Lavenham like something from another time. In the 15th
				and
				16th centuries the town was famous for its wool, and one of the richest settlements in Britain
				because
				of it, but fell into decline with cheaper exports from Europe.

				Now it’s like walking through a fairytale: hundreds of half-timbered buildings spell out the past,
				with
				a contemporary infusion of eateries and places to stay. You can even sip tea in the Tudor tea-room
				at
				the Lavenham Guildhall, one of the finest examples of Lavenham’s heyday.

			<h3>
				5. Castle Combe
			</h3>
			<p>
				Historical as ever, the imposing 15th century St Andrew’s Church reflects the former prosperity of
				the
				Cotswolds’ textile industry. There’s even some historical five-star accommodation: the 14th century
				Manor House Hotel.
				The Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty has a lot to answer for when it comes to beautiful
				English towns to match. Castle Combe is one of them. Claiming to be “the prettiest English town,”
				the
				rest of the world has listened: various movies and TV series have been filmed here, including Steven
				Spielberg’s War Horse and Downton Abbey.
